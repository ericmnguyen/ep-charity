0. FOR THE TECHNICAL EXPLORATION REQUIREMENT OF THE PROJECT, 

- We have implemented jQuery-validate library which is a lightweight front end from validation package  that provides a lot of customizable features. It has been implemented in Event create and edit form. 
- Apart from this we have fully utilized the functionality of @include to manage layouts, alerts, config files and reduce HTML code duplication. We have made use of bootstrap features to make the site as responsive as possible.
- We have handled role-based access seriously and implemented the root directory config file to avoid the uses related to relational links. 
- We have used Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets to speed up our CSS writing making use of features like variable and other features.
